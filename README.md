# Arduino-Hardware-password-manager
This is a single PIN lock for your passwords and usernames, it converts arduino into a hardware password manager<br>
 After uploading open serial monitor with baudrate = 9600 and noline ending.<br>
 There are two codes, "passman_pinset" and "sermon_passman", the "passman _pinset" allows user to set pin and data is not wiped on wrong pin attempt, instead the serial communication is terminated.<br>
 Instead of the arduino serial monitor you can use the customized serial monitor for password manager which ChatGPT made for me.
